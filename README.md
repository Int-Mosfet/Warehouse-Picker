# Warehouse-Picker
An assembly program mimicking operation of a warehouse

This was a final project for a class. The project was very hard, I didn't finish all the features but I got a decent grade on it. I'm just putting the source files on here. The board used was a senior design project at my school, so that's the only place where this code will run or make any sense. I will update this eventually to show some pictures of the board used.
